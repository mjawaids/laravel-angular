# Laravel with AngularJS

This is a sample project to demonstrate integration for Laravel with AngularJS. Currently, this project uses Laravel v5.4 and AngularJS v1.6. I will try my best to keep it up with the latest versions and in future will upgrade to Angular v4+.

Main files to look for are:
Laravel
- web.php - Routes
- TasksController.php - Restfull Controller
- Tasks.php - Model
- Migration files
- resources/views/index.php - Main view file

Angular
- public/js/main.js - Main Angular file

This project demonstrates how angular can be integrated into Laravel and how Angular features can be used like:
- App scopes
- Controllers
- Two way data binding
- Filtering
- AJAX requests
- Automatic view updates
